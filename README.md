# tokenrole
Token-Role Access Control is a Drupal 7 module that allows Drupal to extend its access control to external sub-systems. These sub-systems are usually not stand-alone. Implementing user management on these sub-systems will trigger usability issues since they are integrated with other systems which have their own user management.
